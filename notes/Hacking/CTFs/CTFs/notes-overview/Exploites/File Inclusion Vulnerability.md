## description
This is when a vulnerability allows a attacker to include a file, this can result in the contents of a file being outputed or:
-   Code execution on the web server
-   Code execution on the client-side such as JavaScript which can lead to other attacks such as cross site scripting (XSS)
-   Denial of Service (DoS)
-   Sensitive Information Disclosure

we can test local file inclusion by passing common file directories into the request such as `http://vulnerable_host/preview.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd`

sometimes this vunlrability could lead to remote file inclusion which, if the sever is machine is using [[Windows New Technology LAN Manager]] could lead to the attacker gaining access to the password of the user on the machine
