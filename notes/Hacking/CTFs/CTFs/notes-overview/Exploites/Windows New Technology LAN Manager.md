**Windows New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM)** is a suite of security protocols offered by Microsoft to authenticate usersâ€™ identity and protect the integrity and confidentiality of their activity. At its core, NTLM is a **single sign on (SSO)** tool that relies on **a challenge-response protocol** to confirm the user without requiring them to submit a password.

## it works by:
- **Negotiation message** from the client
- **Challenge message** from the server
- **Authentication message** from the client

the client will send its NTLMv1/v2 password hash to the server during Authentication

## Explotation
This process can be exploited by [[responder]] which prtends to be the server the client is looking for, and therfore can steel the clients hash.
