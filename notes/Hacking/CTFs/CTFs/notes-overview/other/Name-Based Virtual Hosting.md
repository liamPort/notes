## description
this is when multiple domains share a ip adress, the service will look at a request which should include both the domain and ip adress

in the hack the box challenges, bc the domain doesn't exest, we need to add the {ip domin} to the /etc/hosts file which contains hostnames with their ip adresses (dns)
